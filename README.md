A large amount of data has been collected by Dublin City Council (DCC) regarding Transport and
Infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area

You are required to choose a particular area of interest and formulate the appropriate questions for
modelling and analysis. For Example (but not limited to):

- Clamping Appeals
- Multistorey Car Parking Space Availability
- Telecoms Underground Infrastructure DCC
- etcâ€¦

You are required to collect, process, analyse and interpret the data in order to identify possible
issues/ problems at present and make predictions/ classifications in regards to the future. This
analysis will rely on the available data from DCC and any additional data you deem necessary (with
supporting evidence) to support your hypothesis for this scenario.
This will require you to employ critical analysis of not only the domain of choice but also for the
regression and or classification that you undertake.
